Health-literate individuals understand and acknowledge the effects of personal behavior on the health and well-being of others. In addition, they understand the influence that people have on the environment and the way in which elements within the environment affect the health of groups and individuals. Students translate this understanding into concern for the health of others in the family, school, peer group, and community via their animated PSAs.</p>
